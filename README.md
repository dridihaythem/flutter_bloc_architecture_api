# About

This is a simple Flutter app that fetches user and post data from the fake API at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.

This app is an implementation of the bloc architecture (Presentation,Business Logic,Data layer)

Data layer was split into 3 layers : Model, Repository and DataProvider.

I used many concepts :

- MultiRepositoryProvider
- MultiBlocProvider
- MultiBlocListener
- Bloc Builder
- Bloc to Bloc Communication
